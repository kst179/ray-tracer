# Ray Tracer

Simple sequential ray tracer created as university CG course project in 2016.

Supported features:
 * photon maps for all objects
 * flashlight illumination model made of hyperboloid linse and optical lense 
 * mirror surfaces & simple glass modeling
 * adaptable photon map resolution
 * noise reduction via photon maps averaging within small radius (helps reduce noise for high resolution maps)

Result of 4 hour rendering (in 1030x579 resolution):
